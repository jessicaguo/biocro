## BioCro [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev.svg?token=tjzJV6N6JPssJ6yfYPqH&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev)

BioCro is a model that predicts plant growth over time given climate as input.

It uses models of key physiological and biophysical processes underlying plant growth ([Humphries and Long, 1995]), and has previously been used for predicting biomass yield and leaf area index of switchgrass and miscanthus ([Miguez et al., 2009]).

BioCro has also been integrated into a suite of tools that link the model directly with crop trait and yield data, streamlining the entire modeling and data collection workflow (LeBauer et al, 2013). The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer ([PEcAn](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan)) couples BioCro to the [Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database](https://www.betydb.org), enabling model parameterization and optimization, targeted data collection optimized to reduce uncertainty in model predictions, and the management of informatics and HPC computing resources. 

### An example
The BioGro() function accepts initial values, parameters, climate variables, and a set of modules to run. It returns the results in a data frame.

```r
library(BioCro)
data(weather05)
res <- BioGro(weather05)

plot(res)
```

There are parameters and modules for miscanthus (_Miscanthus_ x _giganteus_), sorghum (_Sorghum bicolor_) and willow (_Saliceae salix_).


### Installation
#### Requirements

The [R environment](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 3.2.3 or greater.

On Windows, [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) version 3.3 or higher (3.4 is not recommended as of 2017-09-12 since that version is not frozen), and on Linux, gcc and g++ version 4.9.3 or greater (consult documentation for you distribution for installation instructions).

The roxygen2 R package; from within R, use `install.packages('roxygen2')`.

#### BioCro installation


##### Easy method:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github('ebimodeling/biocro')
```

Alternatives methods:

Clone the BioCro source code from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/ebimodeling/biocro`. Or, [download the source](https://github.com/ebimodeling/biocro/archive/master.zip), unzip the file, and install from the either the command line or from within R using one of the following sets of commands. 

These assume that the source files are in a directory named "biocro".

* From the command line
```
cd path_to_unzipped_directory
R CMD INSTALL biocro
```

* From within R
```
setwd('path_to_unzipped_directory')
install.packages('biocro', repos=NULL, type='SOURCE')
```
